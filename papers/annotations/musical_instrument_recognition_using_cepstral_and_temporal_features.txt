Musical Instrument Recognition Using Cepstral Coefficients and Temporal Features
ref: '[n] - A. Eronen & A. Klapuri, "Musical Instrument Recognition Using Cepstral Coefficients and Temporal Features" in IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 2000'

Summary
Audio features can be split into two categories: spectral and temporal. This paper explores the effectiveness of various features from each category with respect to instrument recognition.


Interesting points:
Similarity between instrument recognition and speaker recognition problems
mention of paper using heirarchical classification
