K NEAREST NEIGHBOURS

K Nearest Neighbours is a method of classification which predicts the label of an unkown input based on the similiarity to the training data.

PARAMETERS
k - number of nearest neighbours to use when predicting class
distance measure - type of distance used to calculate nearest neighbour

PROS
Quick (no training stage)

CONS
entire dataset is required for every new prediction. this affects:
	storage, have to store whole dataset to make prediction
	testing, have to check whole dataset for nearest neighbors
